# Marvel Inspired Jeopardy Game

An online webgame inspired by marvel using HTML, CSS and JS to create a jeopardy style forrmat. 
In this project I am working on using JS to create Majority of this project to practice on subjects we recently learned about such as :

function flipCard() {

this.style.fontSize = "15px"

const firstButton = document.createElement('button')

 card.addEventListener('click', flipCard)
